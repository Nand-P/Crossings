# Crossings
C++ Code for an Arduino-based 4-way traffic light system

The traffic light system includes advanced green lights, pedestrian stop/walk signals and realistic time intervals.

This project was created using TinkerCAD. Components such as breadboards, resistors, LEDs and wires were used to simulate a real circuit. 
The layout file shows the assembly of the circuit, while the code file shows the program written in C++.
